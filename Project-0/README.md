This web service is a simple banking service, allowing anyone to register. They are also able to create as many accounts as they wish, with the capabilities to make deposits, close accounts, as well as completely delete their registered user from the service.

To begin, the user must begin by registering on the home page, where they must enter both a 5-15 character long username and password, where the username must be unique.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After registering, the user must log in, where they will be taken to the home screen. Here they have multiple options:  
1 - open new accounts  
2 - close existing accounts  
3 - deposit into existing accounts  
4 - delete their user account from the service  
5 - logout from the service for the time being  

1 - When opening a new account, the user must provide their login information.   
    Upon creation of the account they will be provided with their account and routing numbers.  
2 - If the user would like to close one of their accounts, they will need to provide their account and routing numbers,  
    since multiple accounts are able to be open at once.  
3 - In order to deposit into their account, the user must provide the account's account/routing number, along with the (proper) amount they would wish to deposit.   
    After doing so they will be told their new balance and returned to the home page.  
4 - For users to delete their account from the service, this requires them to enter their login information.  
    CAUTION: Users deleting their accounts will have ALL information from EACH of their accounts LOST  
5 - Clicking the logout button returns the user to the landing page and will require them to re-enter their login credentials toaccess their account again.
